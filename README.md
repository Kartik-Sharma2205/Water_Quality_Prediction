# Water_Quality_Prediction
Water quality prediction is an important problem that can be addressed using machine learning techniques. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of water in various applications such as drinking water, aquatic ecosystems, and industrial processes.

# MODELS USED -->
The 7 models used are as follows →
- SVM
- KNN
- Decision Tree
- XGBoost
- AdaBoost
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM is a popular algorithm for classification and regression tasks. SVM works by finding the
hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes. In the context of water quality
prediction, SVM can be used to classify water quality as good or bad based on the input features
such as pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, etc.

▪ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is a simple algorithm that works by finding the k-nearest neighbors to a given data point
and using their labels to predict the label of the new data point. In the context of water quality
prediction, KNN can be used to predict the quality of a water sample based on its proximity to
similar water samples in the dataset.

▪ Decision Tree (DT)
DT is a simple yet powerful algorithm for classification and regression tasks. DT works by
recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the value of a chosen attribute, until a leaf
node is reached, which corresponds to the class label or value. In the context of water quality
prediction, DT can be used to predict the quality of a water sample based on a decision tree built
using the input features.

▪ Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
XGBoost is a popular algorithm for regression and classification tasks. It works by building an
ensemble of decision trees that are trained to correct the errors of the previous tree. In the context
of water quality prediction, XGBoost can be used to predict the quality of a water sample based
on a boosted ensemble of decision trees built using the input features.

▪ AdaBoost
AdaBoost is an algorithm that works by building an ensemble of weak learners that are combined
to form a strong learner. In the context of water quality prediction, AdaBoost can be used to
predict the quality of a water sample based on an ensemble of decision trees or other classifiers
built using the input features.

▪ Random Forest (RF)
RF is an algorithm that works by building an ensemble of decision trees that are trained on
random subsets of the input features and data points. In the context of water quality prediction,
RF can be used to predict the quality of a water sample based on an ensemble of decision trees
built using random subsets of the input features.

▪ Logistic Regression (LR)
LR is a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks. It works by modeling the probability of
a data point belonging to the positive class as a function of the input features using a logistic
function. In the context of water quality prediction, LR can be used to predict the probability of a
water sample being of good quality based on the input features.
